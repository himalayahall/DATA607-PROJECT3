3. SKILL  
    Skills (R, NLP, Communication, etc.) and categories. Skill categories are T_SOFTWARE, T_GENERAL, and SOFT. The *T_* prefeix designates *technical* skills - *software* and *general*. The prefix also makes it straightforward to filter technical skills from *soft* skills.

    Education levels (BS, MS, etc.)
    
7. SKILL_IN_DEMAND  
    Skill demand (Source, skill, demand, etc.)
